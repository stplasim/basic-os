# Basic Operating System (BOS)

## What is BOS?
BOS or Basic Operating System is an attempt to make a very simple operating system from scratch. 
It started with a simple bootloader and after several weeks ended in a small operating system which does nothing more than accept text input and react to some commands.
More functions will come (maybe) in the future

## What can I find in this project?
You will find here two main files. 
One is the `os` folder which contains everything to compile the operating system.
The other one is the `examples` folder where you can find some examples of bootloaders.

## How did I find out how to do all these things?
First of all you can find a lot of information and examples with google. 
But my two main sources of information were Stackoverflow and this [PDF](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)

## Will this operating system change my life?
Probably not. But if you are interested in the basic functioning of an operating system I can only recommend such a project.
